And now we gonna get down on the floor
We're gonna turn up the love tonight
Not thinking 'bout the problems anymore
We let the music take us high
So everybody dance, let me see your hands
Let's party to the break of dawn
We're burning down the club
Just turn the music up

Everybody give me five, let's party
Put your hands up in the air, let's go
Baby, now we gonna get it started
But you gonna give me five, oh-ooh

Put your hands up in the air, let's go

But you gonna give me five, oh-ooh

Everybody give me five, let's party
Put your hands up in the air, let's go
Baby, now we gonna get it started
But you gonna give me five, oh-ooh
Everybody give me five, let's party
Put your hands up in the air, let's go
Baby, now we gonna get it started
But you gonna give me five, oh-ooh
Everybody give me five, let's party
