You know what we are
We are one

Yeah
You know what it is?
I wanna ask you to give me five
Let's go!

Five, four, three, two, one
And I wanna see you
Get crazy down on the dancefloor
So let's go!

That's right, come on!
Put the motherfking hands up!
(Verse):
Give me five, let's go
You gotta give me five, whoa oh
You gotta give me five, let's party
But you gotta give me five (five)
whoa oh
(Repeat Verse)

Whoa oh

All right, let's go, ladies and gentlemen
We're going some Hip Hop up in this joy

Come on let's shake that ass
From the left to the right, let me see your hands
And we'll make it clap like you never clapped before
And we'll make you dance till you can't move no more (no more)

It's time for the Easter Rave
You gotta give me five when we bring the bass
'Cause we do it and we do it and we stop
Is how we move it, how we move it till we drop

Don't wait for the afterparty
It's time that we gettin' it started
You gotta go, put that ass on the floor
And gimme gimme gimme, baby, gimme some more

Tonight the ladies gonna drink Bacardi
The babies shake it till it makes me naughty
It's DJ Gollum featuring DJ Cap
Make the boys go crazy and the girls get wet (wet)

You gotta drop this joy

(Chorus #1):
Everybody give me five, let's party (let's party)
Put your hands up in the air, let's go (let's go)
Baby now we're gonna get it started
But you gotta give me five whoa oh (give me five, ahh)
(Repeat Chorus #1)

Raise the hands up right now!

Everybody in this motherfking club
You gotta put your hands up right now!
Clap your hand
We are one, here we go!

Come on!

Put the motherfking hands up right now!
Drop it!

And now we're gonna get down on the floor
We're gonna turn up the love tonight
Not thinking 'bout our problems anymore
We'll let the music take us high

So everbody dance, come let me see your hands
Let's party till the break of dawn
We're burning down the club, just turn the music up
Oh baby, come on!

(Chorus #2):
Everybody give me five, let's party (let's party)
Put your hands up in the air, let's go (let's go)
Baby now we're gonna get it started
But you gotta give me five whoa oh (come on)
(Repeat Chorus #2)

Bring it back! Here we go!

I feel the bass in my venes, feel it in the air
Smiling faces everywhere in the atmosphere
All the lights shine so bright, tonight is the night
It is the best time of my life
So give me five (give me five)

Jump jump!
