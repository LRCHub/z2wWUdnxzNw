and now we're gonna get down on the floor
we're gonna turn up the love tonight
not thinking bout our problems anymore
we'll let the music take us high
so everbody dance
come lemme see ya hands
lets party till the break of dawn
we're burning down the club
just turn the music up
oh baby common
everybody give me five
lets party
put hands up in the air
lets go
baby now were gonna get it started
but you gotta give me five
oh oh
